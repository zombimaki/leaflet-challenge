## Visualizing Data with Leaflet
### Leaflet-Step-1
The Leaflet-Step-1 application performs the following:
1. Loads geoJson data for earthquake activity that occured over the past day.
2. Places markers on the map for where the earthquake activity occured. 
3. The placed markers are sized based on the earthquake magnitude and colored based on the depth of the earthquake having the colors get darker/warmer as the number gets closer to 100.
4. Each marker has a popup of place, time, magnitude, and depth.

### Leaflet-Step-2
1. Loads geoJson data for earthquake activity that occured over the past day.
2. Places markers on the map for where the earthquake activity occured. 
3. The placed markers are sized based on the earthquake magnitude and colored based on the depth of the earthquake having the colors get darker/warmer as the number gets closer to 100.
4. Each marker has a popup of place, time, magnitude, and depth.
5. Loads json data of the tetonic plates.
